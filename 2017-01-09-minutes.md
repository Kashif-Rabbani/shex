## Scratch

This area is for shared scratch.
We enter ideas and proposals at the top.
When moving on to a new topic, we give the shared scratch area a title with "###"s before it and push it down.

### Writing URLs

Since we're using github markdown, urls are entered with []s with link text followed by ()s around the URL.
